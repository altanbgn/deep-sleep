# Deep Sleep
Hobby project to learn Svelte ðŸ™‚. Lets you calculate time of
when should you sleep and when should you wake up. Pretty handy right.
Especially useful for heavy sleeper like myself hhe.

## Guide
If you press **Sleep** and enter desired time want to wake up at, it
calculates the appropriate time to sleep in order to wake up at your given time.

Same goes for **Wake Up**. Entering desired time to sleep will calculate when is
the right time to wake up

Simple right?

I always kinda mix between these two, even when coding ðŸ˜…

Feel free to use my code whenever and however you want.
